# Flutter Quiz App (Archive)

This repository contains the source code for one of my first applications built while learning the Flutter framework. The project is a simple quiz app for the web, created to practice the fundamentals of Flutter and Dart development.

## Repository Status

**Please Note:** This is a public archive and is **not actively maintained**. The code is preserved here for historical and personal reference and **does not reflect my current skill level.**

As this was a "first try" project, the code is provided as-is. Dependencies are likely outdated, and the structure represents an early stage of my learning process with the framework.

## Project Overview

The application is a straightforward quiz website. It was built to understand the core concepts of Flutter, including:

* Building layouts with Widgets.
* Managing state (e.g., tracking scores and question progress).
* Handling user interaction (e.g., button presses).
* Understanding the basics of the Dart programming language.

## Technologies Used

* **Flutter**
* **Dart**
